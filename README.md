# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Our project focuses on Heart Disease Prediction using machine learning. We split the data into three subsets for closer model evaluation. Employing KNN and Random Forest Classifier, we accurately predict heart disease, providing valuable insights for early detection and intervention.
