# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
The project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning. To evaluate the model closely, we split the data into three subsets. By utilizing KNN and Random Forest Classifier algorithms, we accurately predict heart disease, enabling early detection and effective intervention. Benefit from our system's advanced predictive capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.
